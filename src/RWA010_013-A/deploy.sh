# IF we hit block limit we need to parse output from previouse command and set deployed addresses to the ENV (hopefully Foundry will fix vm.setEnv wich we can use for that)
# Then we can simply run another method of Deployment contract and pick up this ENV vars there using `--sig "secondPartOfDeployment()"` flag of `forge script` command
